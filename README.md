# Studend-s-Code
It's one of mine programs, that I've wrote for college. That shit is named as a "Individual Study". Irl it's another homework type shit code.

# Wtf is that?
That's a program for processing information from a .txt file, and console input, i.e. the serealization and deserialization.
It is for input from file, output in file, and executing some awesome easy banal functions like average, searching for an object depending on a condition, and more. 
The hard one was to correctly reading data from file. I have used Buffered Reader/Writer for basic operations and Array List, based on Microwave class, for stocking them.  

# Is it useful? 
Nope. At least for now it isn't. 

# Can you use if i need it?
Absolutely.
